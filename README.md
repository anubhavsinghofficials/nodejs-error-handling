## Introduction to Errors



### Sharp code vs spaghetti code

- Before jumping on to the errors, we must keep in mind to write code in a way that removes the risks of any error. Spaghetti code often introducess unnecessary errors because there are no clear way of writing the code thereby causing some hidden errors that will only be seen when you run the code
- So make your code as sharp/specific as possible for example: separate the business logic from the controllers
- Think of it this way.. "This is a function.. hmm.. what's the 'very' purpose of this function?, that "very purpose" should be here and all the other functionalities necessary to perform during the "very purpose", goes to the utilities/services". In other words, view the every function as a broker/middleman
